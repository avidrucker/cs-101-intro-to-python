# Healthy Expectations

- You're going to make mistakes. It's okay to make mistakes. These mistakes will guide you towards better understanding of your code & knowledge base.
- Your guide/teacher/tutor/coach/instructor/classmate isn't perfect **and** they *can't* read minds. Practice clear communication with the humans around you, expressing what you observe in your code, what your goals are, and how you'd like to get feedback. 
- You will need to practice the material or you will forget it. Even pros look things up and make mistakes, so you shouldn't expect fault-free memory or understanding from yourself either.
- I recommend you start with a rough (written) plan of how you are going to solve whatever coding scenario you face. You could brainstorm a few solutions, or you could look up methods/workflows online. Ideally, you will go about this scientifically, give yourself a rough time limit, and try multiple avenues. Eg. I will reverse this list, using a for loop, in under 10 minutes, and write down why I thought it did/didn't work (well). If that doesn't work, I will look up Pyton's built-in string functions. The point here is to avoid coding aimlessly - believe it or not, many new coders do this.
